# Kellogg-Project for CIS 4990
Enterprise Project Senior Project

In collaboartion with Kellogg's, our team was in charge to build an Alexa Skill for managers to get information about coupons
and sales. The idea of this project is to grab data (provided by Kellogg's) to make Alexa talk about the information from the data.

# GRABBING THE DATA
We were able to store our data and do queries using Apex Oracle (https://apex.oracle.com/en/). The data that we imported into 
Oracle was in a .CVS file and before it was imported into Oracle, we cleaned the data to make it more efficient to use.

# MAKING ALEXA TALK FROM THE DATA
Using an API from Oracle, we were able to accomplish our goal to make Alexa talk about our data.
